    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="file:///Users/briandawkins/Documents/homework/assignment1/Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/biopic.jpg" height=300px width=300px>
    <p>I was born and raised in San Jose, CA by two parents, an older brother, and a yellow labrador retriever. I grew up with a love of chocolate ice cream and chicken nuggets. My favorite ice cream currenty is Saled Malted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough from Salt 'N Straw in Los Angeles. My favorite place to travel growing up was Paris because my parents could afford really nice hotels. My dog's name was Tucker and he lived to be 14 years old. </p>
    <p>In 2010 I went off to the University of Arizona for college and ended up studying Accounting. I love my time in Tucson and my favorite restaurant there was a sandwich shop called Eegees. I went on to get a Masters Degree in Accounting from USC and met my boyfriend, Zach there. We currently live in the Runyon Canyon neighborhood of Hollywood. We love to hike, go to the beach, and lay out at our rooftop pool on weekends. My favorite hikes are in Malibu.</p>
